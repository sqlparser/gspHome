##### Q: When database vendor add new SQL syntax, how long will those SQL syntaxes be supported in general SQL parser?
> General SQL Parser supports both PL/SQL and SQL. Although we try to add support for all SQL syntax of the database, it's quite difficult to make sure all SQL syntax of the database is supported especially keep up with the recent version.
